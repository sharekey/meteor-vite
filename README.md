## Installation

### Meteor v3
```sh
# Install Meteor-Vite and Vite with npm
meteor npm i meteor-vite
meteor npm i -D vite 

# Install the Meteor build plugin
meteor add jorgenvatle:vite
```

### Meteor v2
If you are using Meteor v2 you need to make sure you install Vite v4 and `jorgenvatle:vite-bundler` instead.

```sh
meteor npm i -D vite@4
meteor npm i meteor-vite@2
meteor add jorgenvatle:vite-bundler
```
- [Release branch](https://github.com/JorgenVatle/meteor-vite/tree/v3)

#### Application structure
You can structure your app just like you would with a typical Meteor application. The key difference is the addition of 
a Vite entry file for your Meteor client and server. These will become the primary entrypoints for your app.

If you're installing Meteor-Vite for an existing project, just rename your current client/server entry modules to `entry-vite.ts`.
Then create a new empty `entry-meteor.js` file for your Meteor client and server.

```text
- client/
  - entry-vite.ts    # Write your Meteor client code from here.
  - entry-meteor.js  # Leave empty, Vite will write to this file to load missing dependencies at runtime.
  - index.html
- server/
  - entry-vite.ts     # Write your Meteor server code from here.
  - entry-meteor.js   # If you enable server builds with Vite: Leave empty. Vite will write to this file to load your finished server bundle.
- package.json
- vite.config.ts
```

#### Package.json
Now, make sure you have `mainModule` entry in your `package.json` for each of the new `meteor-entry.js` files.

```json5
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "meteor run",
    "build": "meteor build ../output/vue --directory"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    // ...
  },
  "meteor": {
    "mainModule": {
      "client": "client/entry-meteor.js",
      "server": "server/entry-meteor.js"
    },
  }
}
```

You can leave your `meteor-entry.js` files empty, or write to them if you'd like. Do keep in mind that Vite may write to 
them during development and production bundling. What you add to your `meteor-entry.js` files will be ignored by Vite.
So you should generally avoid adding anything to these modules unless you have a very specific use case that cannot 
be handled by Vite.

#### Vite config
Create a Vite configuration file (`vite.config.ts`) in your project root. And load in the `meteor-vite` plugin.
```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import { meteor } from 'meteor-vite/plugin';

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        meteor({
          clientEntry: 'client/entry-vite.ts',
            
          // Optionally specify a server entrypoint to build the Meteor server with Vite.
          serverEntry: 'server/entry-vite.ts',
          enableExperimentalFeatures: true, // Required to enable server bundling.
        }),
        
        // ... Other Vite plugins here. E.g. React or Vue (See examples below)
    ],
})
```

#### ⚡️ Final steps

Write your code from your `entry-vite.ts` files. Install any Vite plugins you prefer to power your Meteor app. 
See below for examples with popular UI frameworks.

If you have any existing Meteor build plugins like `typescript`, etc. you can safely remove them. 
Vite comes with out-of-the-box support most of these. For the rest, it's usually as simple as just adding a plugin to
`vite.config.ts`.

Start your app and enjoy blazingly fast HMR and builds, all powered by Vite! ⚡️
```sh
meteor run
```

## Example with Vue 3
```js
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import { meteor } from 'meteor-vite/plugin';
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        meteor({
          clientEntry: 'client/entry-vite.ts',
        }),
        vue(),
    ],
    // Other vite options here...
})
```

## Example with Vue 2.7
```js
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import { meteor } from 'meteor-vite/plugin';
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue2'

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        meteor({
          clientEntry: 'client/entry-vite.ts',
        }),
        vue(),
    ],
    // Other vite options here...
})
```

## Example with React
```js
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import { meteor } from 'meteor-vite/plugin';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        meteor({
          clientEntry: 'client/entry-vite.ts',
        }),
        react({
            jsxRuntime: 'classic',
        }),
    ],
    optimizeDeps: {
        exclude: ['@meteor-vite/react-meteor-data'], 
    }
})
```

If your project depends on [`meteor/react-meteor-data`](https://github.com/meteor/react-packages) it might be worthwhile to 
replace it with our npm-published fork [`@meteor-vite/react-meteor-data`](https://github.com/JorgenVatle/meteor-vite/tree/release/npm-packages/%40meteor-vite/react-packages).

The fork simply publishes the package over npm instead of Atmosphere. This has a few benefits. Primarily, Meteor 
won't try to bundle React for you, instead leaving it to Vite. This gives you more flexibility in configuring your React
environment through Vite. And a good boost in build times.

<details>
  <summary>
    Using the official `react-meteor-data` package without npm (advanced)
  </summary>
  
### React with Atmosphere's `react-meteor-data` package
> This approach is generally not the recommended as it introduces a lot of complexity in dependency tracking for code that depends on React.

If you need to use the official `react-meteor-data` package or you still want to stick with the Atmosphere version you will need to instruct Vite to externalize React, so it
isn't included twice in your client bundle.

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import { meteor } from 'meteor-vite/plugin';

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        react(),
        meteor({
            clientEntry: "client/entry-vite.tsx",
            // This instructs Vite to not bundle react and react-dom as they will be bundled by Meteor instead.
            externalizeNpmPackages: ['react', 'react-dom'], 
            stubValidation: {
                warnOnly: true,
                // React uses conditional exports for production and development environments
                // Meteor-Vite ignores these when preparing a stub file for externalized dependencies
                // This prevents warning messages from flooding the console when running your app.
                ignoreDuplicateExportsInPackages: ['react', 'react-dom'],
            },
            meteorStubs: {
                debug: false
            },
        })
    ],
});
```

Then in your Meteor client's `mainModule`, we need to explicitly import React to prevent the Meteor bundler from
omitting unused React components from your bundle.

```ts
// ./client/entry-meteor.js
import 'react';
import 'react-dom';
import 'react-dom/client';
import 'react/jsx-dev-runtime';
import 'react-refresh';

import 'meteor/react-meteor-data';
```

</details>



And that should be it. Write your app from your `vite.tsx` entrypoint and enjoy lightning fast HMR ⚡

## Configuration
The only required config field is your Vite `clientEntry` field. The rest is optional and usually doesn't require
tinkering with.
```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { meteor } from 'meteor-vite/plugin';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    meteor({
      /**
       * Path to the client entrypoint for your app.
       * This becomes your new Vite-powered mainModule for Meteor.
       * @required
       */
      clientEntry: 'client/entry-vite.ts',
        
      /**
       * Enter your Meteor server's entrypoint here to prebuild your Meteor server modules using Vite.

       *
       * Not only does this come with improved performance, but also the flexibility of Vite's build system.
       * The Meteor server is built using Vite SSR mode. To configure just the server builds see
       * {@link https://vite.dev/config/#conditional-config Conditional Configuration docs}
       * @optional
       */
      serverEntry: 'server/entry-vite.ts',
        
      /**
       * Failsafe opt-in to prevent experimental features and configuration from taking effect.
       * Required if {@link serverEntry} is specified.
       */
      enableExperimentalFeatures: true,
      
      /**
       * Skips bundling the provided npm packages if they are already provided by Meteor.
       * This assumes you have a Meteor package that depends on the provided npm packages.
       * @default []
       */
      externalizeNpmPackages: ['react', 'react-dom'],
        
      /**
       * Whether imports for your Vite production assets in your app's index.html file should be generated statically
       * (once during build) or dynamically with every incoming request. Enable if you need to change the base URL of

       * Set METEOR_VITE_BASE_URL=<your cdn url here> in production to override the base URL for your Vite assets.
       * @note Only affects web.browser and web.browser.legacy architectures. Cordova can only have assets generated
       * statically.
       * @default true
       */
      dynamicAssetBoilerplate: false,
      
      /**
       * Configures runtime validation of Meteor package stubs generated by Vite.
       * See Features section in readme for more info
       * @optional

      stubValidation: {
        /**
         * list of packages to ignore export validation for.
         * @default []
         */
        ignorePackages: ['ostrio:cookies'],
        
        /**

        warnOnly: true,
        
        /**
         * Set to true to completely disable stub validation. Any of the above options will be ignored.
         * This is discuraged as `warnOnly` should give you an important heads up if something might be wrong

         * @default false
         */
        disabled: false,
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Meteor plugin settings
There are a couple extra advanced settings you can change through your `package.json` file under `meteor.vite`.
In most cases, you won't need to add anything here.
```json5
// package.json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  // ...
  
  "meteor": {
    "mainModule": { /* ... */ },
    
    // Additional configuration for Meteor-Vite (optional)
    "vite": {
      // If your Vite config file lives in another directory (e.g. private/vite.config.ts), specify its path here
      "configFile": "",
      
      // Replace or remove Meteor packages when bundling Vite for production.
      // This may be useful for a small subset of compiler-plugin packages that interfere with Vite's build process.
      //
      // This is only used during the Vite bundling step. The packages included in your final production 
      // bundle remains unaffected.
      "replacePackages": [
        // Removes standard-minifier packages while building with Vite. (default)
        { "startsWith": "standard-minifier", "replaceWith": "" },

        // Replace refapp:meteor-typescript with the official typescript package. (default)
        { "startsWith": "refapp:meteor-typescript", replaceWith: "typescript" },
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Features in-depth

### Lazy Loaded Meteor Packages
Meteor-Vite will automatically detect lazy loaded Meteor packages and import them into your Meteor client's entrypoint.
This is necessary to ensure that the Vite bundler has access to your Meteor packages.

The imported files can safely be committed to your project repository. If you remove the associated package in the
future, simply remove the import statement.

Our detection for these packages is fairly primitive, so it's best to keep the imports in the Meteor client
entrypoint as specified in the `meteor.mainModule.client` field of your `package.json` file.
```json5
{
  "meteor": {
    "mainModule": {
      "client": "client/entry-meteor.js", // Lazy loaded packages checked for and added to this file.
      "server": "server/entry-meteor.js"
    }
  }
}
```

### Stub validation
Runtime validation at the client is performed for Meteor packages that are compiled by Vite. This is done to avoid a
situation where Meteor-Vite incorrectly exports undefined values from a Meteor Package. Which can lead to silently
broken Meteor packages.

The validation is done simply through verifying that package exports do not have a `typeof` value of `undefined`.
If you do have a package that intentionally has `undefined` exports, you can disable the warning message for this
package by excluding it in your Meteor settings.json file.

Packages that register global exports only for testing may result in false-positives. `ObserveMultiplexer` in 
`meteor/mongo` on the server is a good example of this.

```ts
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
      meteor({
        stubValidation: {
            ignorePackages: ['ostrio:cookies', 'meteor/mongo'],
            
            /**
             * This will prevent the validator from throwing errors
             * when a missing export is detected.
             */
            warnOnly: true,
            
            /**
             * If you want no warnings, you can simply disable the validation outright.
             */
            disabled: false,
        }
      })
  ]
})
```

## Avoid imports in Meteor's client `mainModule`
Code written to or imported by your Meteor client's [`mainModule.client`](https://docs.meteor.com/packages/modules.html#Modular-application-structure) 
will not be processed by Vite, however, it will still by loaded by the Meteor client. So if you have a use case where 
you have some code that you don't want Vite to process, but still want in your client bundle, this would be the place 
to put that.

But do be careful with this - any code that's imported by both your Vite config's [`clientEntry`](#example-with-vue)
and your Meteor `mainModule.client` may lead to the code being included twice in your final production bundle.

To avoid any confusion between the two, we recommend that you name your entry modules in a way that makes it clear
which part is imported where. See [Application Structure](#application-structure) for a recommended naming scheme.

## Meteor build plugins
Meteor-Vite is more or less a replacement for Meteor's entire build system. Standard minifier packages and other 
Meteor-ecosystem build plugins are no longer necessary, you can now lean on the much larger and widely adopted Vite
ecosystem for configuring your app's build process.

If there is functionality provided by a Meteor build plugin that you can't find a Vite-equivalent plugin for, please do
open an issue, and we might be able to port it over for you if there is no other good alternative.

### Compatability with [`zodern:relay`](https://github.com/zodern/meteor-relay#readme)
Since `zodern:relay` depends on a Babel plugin for processing your publication and methods on the client, we need some
extra configuration to make that work with Vite.

We have a separate Vite plugin that should take care of this for you:
- [`@meteor-vite/plugin-zodern-relay`](/npm-packages/@meteor-vite/plugin-zodern-relay#readme)
  - [View documentation](/npm-packages/@meteor-vite/plugin-zodern-relay#readme)
  - [View on npm](https://npmjs.com/@meteor-vite/plugin-zodern-relay)
